/**
 * Enumerated type class to identify AVP value types.

 * <p/>
 * From the spec:
 * <p/>
 * The Data field is zero or more octets and contains information
 * specific to the Attribute.  The format and length of the Data field
 * is determined by the AVP Code and AVP Length fields.  The format of

          The IPFilterRule format is derived from the OctetString AVP Base

    <pre>
             Direction                          (in or out)
             Source and destination IP address  (possibly masked)

             IP fragment flag
             IP options
             ICMP types
    </pre>

          Rules for the appropriate direction are evaluated in order, with
          the first matched rule terminating the evaluation.  Each packet is
          evaluated once.  If no rule matches, the packet is dropped if the
          last rule evaluated was a permit, and passed if the last rule was
          a deny.

          IPFilterRule filters MUST follow the format:
    <pre>
             action dir proto from src to dst [options]

             action       permit - Allow packets that match the rule.
                          deny   - Drop packets that match the rule.

             dir          "in" is from the terminal, "out" is to the
                          terminal.

             proto        An IP protocol specified by number.  The "ip"
                          keyword means any protocol will match.

             src and dst  &lt;address/mask&gt; [ports]

                          The &lt;address/mask&gt; may be specified as:
                          ipno       An IPv4 or IPv6 number in dotted-
                                     quad or canonical IPv6 form.  Only
                                     this exact IP number will match the
                                     rule.
                          ipno/bits  An IP number as above with a mask
                                     width of the form 1.2.3.4/24.  In
                                     this case, all IP numbers from
                                     1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 will match.
                                     The bit width MUST be valid for the
                                     IP version and the IP number MUST
                                     NOT have bits set beyond the mask.
                                     For a match to occur, the same IP
                                     version must be present in the
                                     packet that was used in describing
                                     the IP address.  To test for a
                                     particular IP version, the bits part
                                     can be set to zero.  The keyword
                                     "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6
                                     equivalent.  The keyword "assigned"
                                     is the address or set of addresses
                                     assigned to the terminal.  For IPv4,
                                     a typical first rule is often "deny
                                     in ip! assigned"

                          The sense of the match can be inverted by
                          preceding an address with the not modifier (!),
                          causing all other addresses to be matched
                          instead.  This does not affect the selection of
                          port numbers.

                          With the TCP, UDP and SCTP protocols, optional
                          ports may be specified as:

                             {port/port-port}[,ports[,...]]

                          The '-' notation specifies a range of ports
                          (including boundaries).

                          Fragmented packets that have a non-zero offset
                          (i.e., not the first fragment) will never match
                          a rule that has one or more port
                          specifications.  See the frag option for
                          details on matching fragmented packets.

             options:
                frag    Match if the packet is a fragment and this is not
                        the first fragment of the datagram.  frag may not
                        be used in conjunction with either tcpflags or
                        TCP/UDP port specifications.

                ipoptions spec
                        Match if the IP header contains the comma
                        separated list of options specified in spec.  The
                        supported IP options are:

                        route), rr (record packet route) and ts
                        (timestamp).  The absence of a particular option
                        may be denoted with a '!'.

                tcpoptions spec
                        Match if the TCP header contains the comma
                        separated list of options specified in spec.  The
                        supported TCP options are:

                        mss (maximum segment size), window (tcp window
                        advertisement), sack (selective ack), ts (rfc1323
                        timestamp) and cc (rfc1644 t/tcp connection
                        count).  The absence of a particular option may
                        be denoted with a '!'.

                established
                        TCP packets only.  Match packets that have the RST
                        or ACK bits set.

                setup   TCP packets only.  Match packets that have the SYN
                        bit set but no ACK bit.

                tcpflags spec
                        TCP packets only.  Match if the TCP header
                        contains the comma separated list of flags
                        specified in spec.  The supported TCP flags are:

                        fin, syn, rst, psh, ack and urg.  The absence of a
                        particular flag may be denoted with a '!'.  A rule
                        that contains a tcpflags specification can never

                        offset.  See the frag option for details on
                        matching fragmented packets.

                        combination of ranges or individual types

                        source quench (4), redirect (5), echo request

                        header bad (12), timestamp request (13),
                        timestamp reply (14), information request (15),
                        information reply (16), address mask request (17)

       There is one kind of packet that the access device MUST always
       discard, that is an IP fragment with a fragment offset of one. This
       is a valid packet, but it only has one use, to try to circumvent
       firewalls.

          An access device that is unable to interpret or apply a deny rule
          MUST terminate the session.  An access device that is unable to
          interpret or apply a permit rule MAY apply a more restrictive
          rule.  An access device MAY apply deny rules of its own before the
          supplied rules, for example to protect the access device owner's
          infrastructure.

       The rule syntax is a modified subset of ipfw(8) from FreeBSD, and the
       ipfw.c code may provide a useful base for implementations.

  /**
          The QosFilterRule format is derived from the OctetString AVP Base
          Format.  It uses the ASCII charset.  Packets may be marked or
          metered based on the following information that is associated with
          it:
    <pre>
             Direction                          (in or out)
             Source and destination IP address  (possibly masked)
             Protocol
             Source and destination port        (lists or ranges)
             DSCP values                        (no mask or range)
    </pre>

          Rules for the appropriate direction are evaluated in order, with
          the first matched rule terminating the evaluation.  Each packet is
          evaluated once.  If no rule matches, the packet is treated as best
          effort.  An access device that is unable to interpret or apply a
          QoS rule SHOULD NOT terminate the session.

       QoSFilterRule filters MUST follow the format:
    <pre>
       action dir proto from src to dst [options]

                    tag    - Mark packet with a specific DSCP
                             [DIFFSERV].  The DSCP option MUST be
                             included.
                    meter  - Meter traffic.  The metering options
                             MUST be included.

       dir          The format is as described under IPFilterRule.

                    proto        The format is as described under
                    IPFilterRule.
