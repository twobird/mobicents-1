 * Defines an interface representing the PoC-Information grouped AVP type.<br>

 * From the Diameter Ro Reference Point Protocol Details (3GPP TS 32.299 V7.1.0) specification:
 * <pre>
 * 7.2.78 PoC-Information AVP
 * The PoC-Information AVP (AVP code 879) is of type Grouped. Its purpose is to allow the transmission of additional
 * PoC service specific information elements. 
 * 
 * It has the following ABNF grammar: 
 *  PoC-Information ::= AVP Header: 879 
 *      [ PoC-Server-Role ] 
 *      [ PoC-Session-Type ] 
 *      [ Number-Of-Participants ]

 *      [ PoC-Controlling-Address ] 
 *      [ PoC-Group-Name ] 
 *      [ PoC-Session-Id ]
