/**
 * Defines an interface representing the PS-Furnish-Charging-Information grouped AVP type.<br>
 * <br>
 * From the Diameter Ro Reference Point Protocol Details (3GPP TS 32.299 V7.1.0) specification: 
 * <pre>
 * 7.2.86 PS-Furnish-Charging-Information AVP 
 * The PS-Furnish-Charging-Information AVP (AVP code 865) is of type Grouped. Its purpose is to add online charging
 * session specific information, received via the Ro reference point, onto the Rf reference point in order to 
 * facilitate its inclusion in CDRs.
 * This information element may be received in a CCA message via the Ro reference point. In situations where online and
 * offline charging are active in parallel, the information element is transparently copied into an ACR to be sent on
 * the Rf reference point.
 * 
 * It has the following ABNF grammar: 
 *  PS-Furnish-Charging-Information ::= AVP Header: 865 
 *      { TGPP-Charging-Id }
 *      { PS-Free-Format-Data } 
 *      [ PS-Append-Free-Format-Data ]
 * </pre>
