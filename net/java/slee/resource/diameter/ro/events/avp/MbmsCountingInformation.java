/**
 * Java class to represent the MBMS-2G-3G-Indicator enumerated type.
 * <pre>
 * 17.7.17  MBMS-Counting-Information AVP
 * The MBMS-Counting-Information AVP (AVP code 914) is of type Enumerated, and contains explicit information about whether the MBMS Counting procedures are applicable for the MBMS Service that is about to start. See 3GPP TS 25.346 [72].
 * This AVP is only valid for UTRAN access type.
 * 
 * The following values are supported:
 * COUNTING-NOT-APPLICABLE (0)
 *   The MBMS Session Start Procedure signalled by the BM-SC is for a MBMS Service where MBMS Counting procedures are not applicable.
 * COUNTING-APPLICABLE (1)
 *   The MBMS Session Start Procedure signalled by the BM-SC is for a MBMS Service where MBMS Counting procedures are applicable.
